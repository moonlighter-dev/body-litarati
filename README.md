an emotional and physical literacy and tracking app

This app is not your typical "Body Tracking" app. Instead of reading and interpreting raw data, the app asks the user to answer simple, quick questions to enable them to track their emotional and physical state. Using my background in complementary medicine, I have customized the questions and created a template for user/app interaction. Time spent logging health information should be under 2 minutes, and easily accessible.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Nodejs, Reactjs

React project. Wanting to play around with components and build an app that I can use to track my daily emotional state and physical symptoms without it being a huge undertaking. Trying to simulate a game-like feel, like the app asks simple questions that are answered quickly, and then stores responses daily, also accepts input and updates quickly.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

I hope to optimize this app with push notifications and availability for use on mobile, so that the app prompts the user to respond quickly and then fades away.

Also once data is accumulated, reporting the data can have lots of opportunities for optimization, as well as the ability to bundle and send, and for increased user security measures and options.

## Lessons Learned:

Still learning, I will let you know....
